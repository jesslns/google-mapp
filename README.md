# README

This is my first map app, (I call it mApp for tentatively, naming to be confirmed).

### Motivation
Seeing many facebook users check-in to some hidden gems or hipster places in Hong Kong, I would like to make an app to store those information and categorise the checked-in spots, so that I can retrieve them.

### Approach
- Google map API
- JavaScript
